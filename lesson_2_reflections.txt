What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It allows a repo to be ready for git. By initializing it, a repo becomes
tracked and ready for commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It creates an intermediate stage for changes to be seen before a commit
is made.
