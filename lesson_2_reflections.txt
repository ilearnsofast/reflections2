What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It allows a repo to be ready for git. By initializing it, a repo becomes
tracked and ready for commits.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It creates an intermediate stage for changes to be seen before a commit
is made.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

Check staging area with working directory frequently to monitor changes.
As soon as a logical change is made, add it to the staging area and use 
git diff to check out the differences between the two. Then if the
change represents one logical change, use git commit to add another
commit to the repository.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be especially useful for trying out a new mode or new 
language of the original code base without diverging from the original
file's path. For example, with the easy-mode branch, one can freely 
experiment the level of easiness to adjust the game to without fear of 
confusing the original code with the new code because they are in 
different branches.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It allows visual understanding towards where each branch leads to, 
which commits are reachable and which commits are not.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together allows the user to use git log on the new 
node to explore all of the previous commits formatted by timestamp. 
One can also use git show commitid to find compare the difference 
between the commitid and its parent.
